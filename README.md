Project Title:
Fit My CV – Smart Resume Analyzer Using AI

Project Description:
Fit My CV is an AI-powered web application designed to simplify and automate the process of resume analysis and job role matching. The system allows users to upload their resumes in PDF format and leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant skills from the resume content.

Once the skills are extracted, the application compares them against a predefined set of job roles and their required skills. Based on this comparison, it calculates a match score and suggests the top 3 most suitable job roles for the user, along with the matched skills for each role.

This project eliminates the need for manual resume screening and provides job seekers with immediate insights into the roles they are best suited for, based on their qualifications and experience.
